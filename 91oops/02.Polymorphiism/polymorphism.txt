polymorphism



                        Key Advanced Concepts:
In Python, advanced polymorphism involves techniques beyond simple method overriding, including duck typing, operator overloading, and leveraging inheritance for flexible code that can handle different object types without needing to know their specific classes.

                                Key Advanced Concepts:

    Duck Typing:

Focuses on an object's behavior rather than its class, allowing you to treat objects as if they belong to a certain type as long as they have the necessary methods, regardless of their actual class.
Example: You might have functions that work with any object that has a len() method, even if those objects are from different classes.

    Operator Overloading:

Allows you to define how operators (like +, -, *, etc.) behave when used with your custom objects.
Example: You can make it so that + adds two objects of your custom class, rather than just numbers.

Inheritance and Method Overriding:

While foundational, advanced use of inheritance involves designing class hierarchies that allow for flexible polymorphism.
Example: Creating a base class with a generic method and then having subclasses redefine that method to perform specific actions based on the object type.

    Abstract Classes and Interfaces:

Use abstract classes to define a common interface that subclasses must implement, ensuring that all subclasses have certain methods.
Example: A Shape class with abstract methods like area() and perimeter(), forcing subclasses like Circle and Square to implement them.

    Type Hints and Annotations:

While not directly part of polymorphism, type hints can improve code readability and help catch potential issues related to polymorphism at development time.
Example: Using type hints to specify that a function expects an object that implements a certain method.
